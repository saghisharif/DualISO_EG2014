This is a somewhat-modified version of the rawspeed development branch, revision:
https://github.com/klauspost/rawspeed/commit/a251d0176ae23972974102fadae65dbdd4b26528

The cameras.xml that's included here should be good for quite awhile, but it
can always be replaced with an updated one from Klaus' branch.

Klaus is a windows programmer.  It's unknown which version of Visual Studio he
uses, but it's not a recent one since it doesn't know anything about std 
namespaces, nor does it apparently even need you to include stuff that should
be.  Precompiled headers maybe?  Ugh.  Anyways, stuff appears to be working now, but
upgrading will be another couple hours of work if there's a new version of rawspeed 
you want.
